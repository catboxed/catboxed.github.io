title: Welcome to Minecraft: Star Edition's Launcher
---
Minecraft: Star Edition is an unfaithful fork of an earlier modification called 'The Right Branch of Development', created by alexcrish. Now packed with more action and fun features!
This Launcher uses [OLauncher](https://github.com/olauncher/olauncher), an open source modified version of the old Minecraft Launcher supporting Microsoft authentication and more. Made by bigfoot. [OLauncher's Discord server](https://discord.gg/zqYZknvYuZ).

Thank you for choosing this mod, and have fun!<br>
